The Tic Tac Toe game built using React is a web-based implementation of the classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is to get three of their symbols (usually X and O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

In this version of the game, players interact with the game board through a user interface rendered in a web browser. The game state is managed using React components, which handle player moves, track game progress, and determine the outcome (win, lose, or draw).

Players take turns clicking on empty squares to place their symbol. After each move, the game checks for winning combinations or a draw condition. If a player achieves three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game. If all squares are filled without a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.

The game interface provides feedback to players, indicating whose turn it is and displaying the game's outcome when it ends. Additionally, players can restart the game to play again.

Overall, the Tic Tac Toe game built using React offers an interactive and engaging experience for players while demonstrating fundamental concepts of React development, including state management, component composition, and user interaction handling.
